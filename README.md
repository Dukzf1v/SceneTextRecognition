### Text Recognition Process in Images

The typical process for **Text Recognition in Images** consists of two main stages:

1. **Text Detection (Detector):** 
   - Identifies the locations of text blocks within the image.

2. **Text Recognition (Recognizer):**
   - Decodes the text at the identified locations.

This project develop a **Text Recognition in Image** program using:
- **YOLOv11** for **Text Detection**.
- **CRNN** for **Text Recognition**.
